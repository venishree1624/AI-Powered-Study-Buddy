# AI-Powered Study Buddy

## Overview
AI-Powered Study Buddy is an intelligent learning assistant designed to help students understand academic content more effectively. The system processes study material and provides automated summaries, question-answering support, and flashcard generation.

## Internship Context
This project was developed as part of the **Edunet Foundation – IBM SkillsBuild Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Internship (6 Weeks)**.  
The project demonstrates the practical application of NLP techniques for building an AI-powered study assistant.

## Features
- Text and PDF-based input processing
- Extractive text summarization using TF-IDF
- Question Answering from study material
- Automatic flashcard generation for revision
- Implemented using Python and NLP techniques

## Dataset
A custom Kaggle dataset was created by uploading a study-material PDF. The dataset is processed directly within the Kaggle notebook to extract text and generate learning aids.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Kaggle Notebook
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF)
- PyPDF2

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Kaggle or Jupyter Notebook
2. Attach the dataset (PDF) to the notebook
3. Run all cells to generate outputs

## Results
The system successfully generates summaries, answers questions based on the content, and creates flashcards to assist in exam preparation.
