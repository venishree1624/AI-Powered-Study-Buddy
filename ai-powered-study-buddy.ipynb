    "\n",
    "The AI-Powered Study Buddy is an academic project developed as part of the Edunet Foundation – IBM SkillsBuild Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning internship to demonstrate the application of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in education.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project processes educational study material provided in PDF format and helps students by generating summaries, answers to questions, quizzes, and flashcards for effective exam preparation. Text is extracted from documents, preprocessed, and analyzed using TF-IDF–based methods to identify important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemented using Python, scikit-learn, NLTK, and PyPDF2, the project runs in a Kaggle Notebook environment with a private Kaggle dataset created for demonstration purposes. This project showcases how basic ML techniques can be used to build an intelligent and practical study assistance system."

    "## ⚙️ Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "This project follows a traditional Machine Learning–based Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to assist students in studying educational content.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**  \n",
    "   Educational study material is collected in PDF format and uploaded as a private Kaggle dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Extraction**  \n",
    "   Text is extracted from PDF documents using the PyPDF2 library.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Text Preprocessing**  \n",
    "   The extracted text is cleaned by converting to lowercase and removing unnecessary line breaks to improve processing quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Text Representation**  \n",
    "   TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) is used to convert text into numerical vectors for similarity-based analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Summarization**  \n",
    "   Important sentences are selected using TF-IDF scores to generate concise summaries of study material.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Question Answering**  \n",
    "   User questions are answered by identifying the most relevant sentences based on TF-IDF similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Flashcard & Quiz Generation**  \n",
    "   Key concepts are identified using TF-IDF keywords to automatically generate flashcards and quiz questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures an explainable, lightweight, and efficient study assistant without relying on large language models.\n"
